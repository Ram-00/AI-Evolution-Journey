Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

=== ANSWER ===
Based on the retrieved evidence, I found the following information:

* The receipt shows the total amount due as 525.00, which is calculated by adding the subtotal of 500.00 to the GST (Goods and Services Tax) of 25.00. This information can be found in (receipt.png#C1).
* The GST value is mentioned as 5% of the subtotal. To calculate this value, I would multiply the subtotal by 0.05, which gives me 25.00.

So, the total amount due and tax values are:

* Total: 525.00 (receipt.png#C1)
* Subtotal: 500.00 (receipt.png#C1)
* GST: 25.00 (receipt.png#C1)

No other tax values were mentioned in the retrieved evidence.

=== ANSWER ===
Based on the retrieved evidence, I can summarize the key points as follows:

* The invoice is from TechTrend Innovations Pvt. Ltd. to Sunrise Enterprises. The invoice number is INV-2025-081, and the due date is September 20, 2025. (invoice.pdf:page1#C1)
* There are three items purchased: Apples (1 kg), Atta (5 kg), and Milk (1L). The subtotal is 500.00, GST (5%) is 25.00, and the total payment is 525.00. (receipt.png#C1)

Note that I did not find any relevant information in the captions (CAP) for these chunks, as they are context-only and do not provide factual claims.
