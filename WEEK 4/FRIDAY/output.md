Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

--- ANSWER ---
Based on the retrieved evidence, I can summarize the following key entities:

* Entity: Names
        + SAI MART MUMBAI (no specific name mentioned)
* Entity: Dates
        + 21/08/2025 (mentioned as the date of transaction)
* Entity: Totals
        + Subtotal: ₹500.00 (sample_doc.png#C1)
        + Total: ₹525.00 (sample_doc.png#C1)

Note that there is no specific name mentioned in the document, only a store name "SAI MART MUMBAI".

=== QUESTION ===
List any invoice IDs or references and their context.
 Retrieve evidence...
Top IDs: sample_doc.png#C1
 Answer with citations...

--- ANSWER ---
Based on the retrieved evidence, I found one invoice-related information:

* Invoice ID/Reference: Not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the invoice reference is "SAI MART MUMBAI 21/08/2025" as this phrase appears at the top of the document (FILE#C1).

This is the only mention of an invoice ID or reference in the provided evidence.

=== QUESTION ===
Are there inconsistencies between amounts mentioned? Explain.
 Retrieve evidence...
Top IDs: sample_doc.png#C1
 Answer with citations...

--- ANSWER ---
After reviewing the retrieved evidence, I found that there may be an inconsistency in the calculations.

The subtotal is calculated as 500.00, and then GST (5%) is applied to get a total of 525.00. However, if we calculate the GST correctly, it would be 5% of 500.00, which is 25.00. This amount already matches the GST mentioned in the invoice.

The inconsistency arises when comparing the SUBTOTAL and TOTAL amounts. If we add the subtotal to the GST (25.00), we get a total of 525.00, which matches the mentioned TOTAL. However, if we simply add the ATTA (250.00) price to the MILK (70.00) price and APPLES (180.00) price, we get:

250.00 + 70.00 + 180.00 = 500.00

This calculation does not include the SUBTOTAL, which is already calculated as 500.00.

To clarify this inconsistency, I would ask: Can you please explain how the subtotal was calculated, and what was included in that amount? Was it a total of all items, or something else?
