# AI Evolution Journey

Welcome to my 12-week upskilling adventure in AI, AGI, and AI agents! Think of this as evolving from a curious newbie to a savvy explorer, blending technical deep dives with relatable everyday analogies—like comparing an AI agent to a barista who nails your coffee order without a word. We'll cover cutting-edge trends (reinforcement learning, multimodal AI, quantum integrations) through daily hands-on tasks, multidisciplinary insights (computer science, neuroscience, ethics, economics), and balanced discussions on disruptions (productivity boosts vs. bias risks). All grounded in verifiable data as of July 2025.

This repo serves as the hub for code demos, reflections, and community contributions. Join the journey on LinkedIn with #AIEvolution—let's debate, collaborate, and advance together!

## About Me
Aspiring AI enthusiast upskilling in agents, AGI, and emerging disruptions. Passionate about iterative learning, ethical tech, and fostering community debates to drive collective progress.

## 12-Week Campaign Outline
Each week builds iteratively: Start broad, dive deep, reflect on applications and ethics. Daily posts on LinkedIn with GitHub shares for code, demos, and peer reviews.

- **Week 1: AI Basics – Laying the Foundation** (Broad overviews: Intro to AI agents, history, narrow AI, AGI concepts, daily life apps, ethics, reflection)
- **Week 2: Diving into AI Agents** (Mechanics and tools: Architectures, multi-agent systems, RAG, learning mechanisms, building tools, ethical agents, reflection)
- **Week 3: Reinforcement Learning Deep Dive** (Fundamentals, advanced algorithms, RL in agents, ethics, projects, disruptions, reflection)
- **Week 4: Multimodal AI Explorations** (Basics, in agents, generative models, ethics, tasks, disruptions, reflection)
